# Discussion

Creative Learning takes as its theoretical foundation the work of Seymour Papert, who created a theory of learning called *Constructionism* which grew out of earlier work by Jean Piaget know as *Constructivism*. Papert believed that "The role of the teacher is to create the conditions for invention rather than provide ready-made knowledge.‚Äù

Today libraries around the world are exploring how to create the conditions for invention for diverse activities, from hands-on crafts to 3D printing. Think back to a time when you witnessed someone being creative or exploring a new idea in the library. Describe what you saw, and discuss the conditions that helped make it happen, as well as any conditions that made it more difficult.
