## Introduction to Learning Creative Learning

In this video, Mitch Resnick introduces the core ideas of creative learning and how those ideas are inspired by the way children learn in kindergarten.

## Readings

[Lifelong Kindergarten, Chapter 1, excerpts](https://learn.media.mit.edu/lcl/resources/readings/chapter1-excerpt.pdf?pdf=ch1-en)

[Gears of my Childhood](https://learn.media.mit.edu/lcl/resources/activity/week1/gears.pdf?pdf=gears.en), by Seymour Papert.

## Discussion

Creative Learning takes as its theoretical foundation the work of Seymour Papert, who created a theory of learning called *Constructionism* which grew out of earlier work by Jean Piaget know as *Constructivism*. Papert believed that "The role of the teacher is to create the conditions for invention rather than provide ready-made knowledge.‚Äù

Today libraries around the world are exploring how to create the conditions for invention for diverse activities, from hands-on crafts to 3D printing. Think back to a time when you witnessed someone being creative or exploring a new idea in the library. Describe what you saw, and discuss the conditions that helped make it happen, as well as any conditions that made it more difficult.


## Activities

*Mapping the 4 P's in your Library*

Find a rough floorplan of your library and print one out for each participant. Spend 20 minutes walking around your space looking for examples of the 4Ps. You might come upon a person who is clearly passionate about what they are doing, or a group of peers sitting near one another. When you find one, mark it on your map along with a few notes describing what you saw.

Now rejoin and have each person describe where and what they encountered. Now create a rough map of your library based on what you found today and what you know about it more generally. Where do groups of peers gather? Where do people work on projects? What areas tend to be most playful? Think about which areas have the potential to support additional "P's", and how you might try changing the space to catalyze creative learning.
