## Learning Creative Learning *in Libraries* ##

Learning Creative Learning in Libraries is a remix of the Learning Creative Learning course created by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at MIT Media Lab.  It is built around the same elements and structure as the original LCL, but invites participants to consider how creative learning works in libraries. 

In addition to understanding Resnick's 4 P's (Projects, Peers, Passion, and Play), the course explores the following questions:

* Creative learning is about "creating the conditions for invention" (Papert). How can the theory of creative learning inform the design and facilitation of environments and activities to create the conditions for invention in libraries?

* How is creative learning that occurs in libraries different from the kind of learning that happens in schools?
