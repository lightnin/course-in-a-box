## Learning Creative Learning *in Libraries* ##

Learning Creative Learning in Libraries is a remix of the Learning Creative Learning course created by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at MIT Media Lab.  The intention of this version is to follow the main ideas of the original LCL while tailoring discussions, readings, and other material to the needs and interests of librarians interested in developing creative learning or "tinkering" experiences.  

In addition to understanding Resnick's 4 P's (Projects, Peers, Passion, and Play), the course explores the following questions:

* Creative learning is about "creating the conditions for invention" (Seymour Papert). How can the theory of creative learning inform the design and facilitation of environments and activities to create the conditions for invention in libraries?

* How is creative learning that occurs in libraries different from the kind of learning that happens in schools?

For each week you'll find a link to the main introductory video featuring professor Mitch Resnick, a selection of readings, and some discussion questions. The course is designed for small groups of librarians interested in having active discussions about these ideas and how they can be applied in the world of libraries.  

This remix has been developed by Amos Blanton, a former member of the Scratch Team at the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at MIT Media Lab, as part of his PhD studies at Aarhus University in collaboration with the Aarhus Public Library at Dokk1 in Denmark.
